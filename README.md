# MineSweeperCPP

This is the source code for a text-based Minesweeper Game programmed in C++.
The original version was programmed as a 1-day challenge from myself and was very limited, with a set board size of 10 * 10 and 50 bombs.

The Updated mineSweeperV2.cpp has 3 difficulties and a Custom mode, however both versions are still not identical to the original Minesweeper game. I'll update this in the future!

Enjoy!
